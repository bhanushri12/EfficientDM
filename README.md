# README: Quantization of Diffusion Models with PyTorch

This project demonstrates the quantization of a diffusion model using PyTorch. It includes both **Post-Training Quantization (PTQ)** and **Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)** approaches. The quantized models aim to reduce the computational and memory footprint of diffusion models while maintaining competitive performance.

## Requirements

Ensure the following dependencies are installed:

- Python >= 3.8
- PyTorch >= 1.11
- torchvision >= 0.12
- Additional packages: numpy, matplotlib, tqdm

To install all required packages, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Key Concepts

### 1. **Post-Training Quantization (PTQ)**:
PTQ applies quantization on a pre-trained model without retraining. It is a faster approach but might result in reduced performance due to limited adaptation to lower precision.

### 2. **Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)**:
QAT simulates the effects of quantization during training, allowing the model to adapt to precision loss. This approach typically yields better results but requires retraining.

## PTQ Workflow

1. **Prepare the Pre-trained Model**:
   Load a pre-trained diffusion model as the base for PTQ.

2. **Apply Quantization**:
   Use PyTorch's `torch.quantization` utilities for static quantization:
   - Fuse modules (e.g., Conv + BatchNorm + ReLU).
   - Define quantization configuration (e.g., `PerChannelAffine`).

3. **Convert and Evaluate**:
   Quantize the model and evaluate its performance.

## QAT Workflow

1. **Modify the Training Loop**:
   Incorporate QAT into the training pipeline using `torch.quantization.prepare_qat`.

2. **Simulate Quantization**:
   During training, simulate quantization effects (e.g., fake quantization).

3. **Fine-tune the Model**:
   Fine-tune the model to adapt to quantization-related precision changes.

## Additional Notes

- **Limitations**:
  - PTQ might show significant degradation if the model lacks robustness to lower precision.
  - QAT requires longer training time and computational resources.
